# Description
This Arduino sketch is designed for the MKR IoT Carrier board, enabling it to measure environmental conditions and upload the data to ThingSpeak. It uses the onboard sensors to read temperature, humidity, and pressure, then connects to WiFi and sends these readings to a ThingSpeak channel using the specified API key. The sketch requires the Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier, WiFiNINA, and WiFiClient libraries for operation.
